About Programming with C#

There are many programming languages in use today.  Choosing a language to program in can be decided based on many factors such as learning curve, job specific requirements, platform specifics, or a plethora of other criteria. 

The C# programming language was created from the ground up to be an object-oriented programming language that offers ease of use, familiarity to C/C++ and Java developers, along with enhanced memory and resource management.  C# is prevalent on the Microsoft platform but is also being used to develop software that runs on Linux, Android, and iOS devices as well.  

Learning C# can position the student well for future programming opportunities, provides a solid foundation in object-oriented programming knowledge, and paves the way for learning other programming languages.   This course aims to teach the student about the core aspects of the C# language.

This course is not a beginner course on C#, although beginners can still learn a lot from the material.  It is intended to provide an introduction to the C# language and the world of .NET programming for existing programmers who need or want to learn more about C# and managed code development.

At the end of this course, you should be able to:
